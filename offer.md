Hi, Sorry about the pull request, it was the only way I could contact you. I am trying to start a new open source project with the name of HexBat,

because I just reserved the name hexbat.com and there are not that many two syllable names free for the .com space.

So, we are not married to the name hexbat yet, but are strongly considering it !

And I was wondering if I could come to some sort of financial agreement with you, the account holder, where I could use this name on github ?

My email is willwoodlief@gmail.com should you want to follow up on this. Thanks
